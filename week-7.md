# Week 7

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
> having to look at its code.
> This is very important.
> This makes it possible for you to separate your module’s documented interface
> from its internal implementation (guts).
> This is good because it means that you are free to change the module’s
> internals as long as the interface remains the same.
>
> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.
