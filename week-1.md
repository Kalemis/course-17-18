troubleshooting tips.

#### Step A

If you haven‚Äôt already, [sign up for GitHub and install a text
editor][materials].

#### Step B

Take some time to set up your [GitHub profile][profile].  Include your name, a
profile picture, and a URL to your homepage.  You‚Äôre allowed to stay anonymous
online for this course by omitting sensitive information, but a good looking
GitHub profile can help you get an internship or job later.

#### Step C

Create a directory on your computer, `run`.  In it, create a file `tutorial.sh`
and copy-paste the complete following document into it.

<details>
<summary><code>tutorial.sh</code> (click the arrow to expand)</summary>

```sh
#!/bin/bash

</details>

#### Step D

In your terminal, go to the `run` directory and enter it (**hint**: use the
`cd` command to ‚Äúchange directories‚Äù).

If you now run `ls` (to print out files) in the directory, you should see the
tutorial:

```sh
$ ls
# tutorial.sh
```

Now, run the tutorial with `sh tutorial.sh`:

```sh
$ sh tutorial.sh
# Hi! üëã
# Follow this tutorial by running `sh tutorial.sh`.  Stuck?  Use `man` (such
# as `man ls`) in another tab for help!
#
# Results (0/14)
# ‚Ä¶
```

This tutorial is interactive.  Answer any questions it asks you, until it sends
you back here.

#### Complete

Sweet!  Welcome back!  If you completed the tutorial, you were given a code.
Now we‚Äôre going to hand in that code to mark your assignment as complete.

#### Description

In this course, you‚Äôll find yourself staring at that black screen with green
letters a lot.
You‚Äôll type the same commands over and over again.
As you‚Äôll spend so much time there, it makes sense to make the command line
more useful, and prettier.

In this assignment you‚Äôll customise your command line by changing a config file.
The file in question, called your profile, is often called `.bash_profile`,
`.profile`, or `.bashrc`, depending on your operating system.
To find the file you need to edit in your case, go to your root directory
(`cd ~`) and print out hidden files there (`ls -a`).
If one of the previously mentioned files exists, you‚Äôre supposed to edit that.
If multiple files exist, open each and inspect them to find out which one you
should edit.

For this assignment:

*   Add aliases (for example, I have `alias ..="cd .."` set up)
*   Modify your prompt (for example, I have `PS1="üöÄ \$(basename \$(pwd))"` set
    up)
*   And add other configuration you see fit

‚Ä¶in your profile.

See the aforementioned extra resources for tips to get started.
You‚Äôre expected to review a lot of existing examples, and do a lot of searching
online.
You can change other files, such as `.gitconfig`, if you feel like it.
Make sure to document anything you add with comments (`#` starts a line comment
in Bash).

Hand in your project by creating a new repository on GitHub:
`username/dotfiles` (in my case `wooorm/dotfiles`).

In your repository, include the changed and added files.
Also include a `readme.md`, documenting how to install your config files, what
they do, and who you are.
For example, something like [this](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles#readme).

Finally, mark this assignment as complete by opening an issue on our
[GitHub issue tracker][profile-issue].  Include a link to your repository.
Let us know in the issue what you thought of the exercises.
